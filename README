## Overview
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard provides an interactive way to explore the diversity of microbial species found in human navels. The dataset reveals that a small number of microbial species are present in over 70% of people, while the rest are relatively rare.

## Features
- Dropdown menu to select different test subjects
- Horizontal bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual
- Bubble chart visualizing the sample values for each OTU
- Demographic information panel for each test subject
- Responsive design for use on various devices

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the dashboard
- `static/js/app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the code to build the charts and handle user interactions
- `samples.json`: The JSON file containing the dataset (not used directly, as data is fetched from a URL)
- `README.md`: This README file
